# JavaScript Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript mini projects built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The goal of this repository is to strengthen core JavaScript fundamentals through hands-on practice and real-world examples.

## Objectives
- Understand JavaScript basics and ES6 features
- Practice DOM manipulation and event handling
- Implement input validation and user interactions
- Build interactive UI components without frameworks
- Improve problem-solving and debugging skills

## Projects Included

### 1. Counter App
- Increase, decrease, and reset counter value
- Dynamic color change based on value
- Demonstrates DOM manipulation and event handling
### 2. Simple Calculator
- Performs basic arithmetic operations
- Handles input validation and error cases
- Demonstrates function usage and numeric conversions
### 3. Real Calculator UI
- Button-based calculator similar to mobile UI
- Supports decimal values and operator precedence
- Demonstrates string handling and expression evaluation
### 4. To-Do List Application
- Add, delete, and mark tasks as completed
- Prevents empty task input
- Demonstrates dynamic DOM creation and class manipulation
### 5. Form Validation
- Validates username, email, and password fields
- Uses regular expressions for email validation
- Prevents form submission on invalid input
### 6. Digital Clock
- Displays the current time in hours, minutes, and seconds
- Updates automatically every second using `setInterval()`
- Uses the JavaScript `Date` object to fetch real-time system time
- Formats time values with leading zeros for consistency
### 7. Stopwatch
- Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch functionality
- Displays time in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds
- Uses `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()` for accurate time tracking
- Prevents multiple timers from running simultaneously
### 8. Countdown Timer
- Allows users to set a countdown duration in minutes
- Counts down in real time and updates every second
- Converts minutes into seconds for simplified time calculations
- Uses `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()` for timer control
- Includes input validation and reset functionality
### 9. Quiz App
- Displays multiple-choice questions dynamically
- Tracks user answers and calculates final score
- Uses arrays and objects to manage quiz data
- Updates UI dynamically without page reload
### 10. Notes App
- Allows users to add and delete notes
- Saves notes using browser local storage
- Automatically loads saved notes on page refresh
- Demonstrates data persistence and dynamic DOM manipulation
### 11. Expense Tracker
- Tracks income and expenses with real-time balance updates
- Allows users to add and delete transactions
- Uses local storage to persist data
- Demonstrates array operations and dynamic DOM updates

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open any project folder
3. Open the HTML file in a web browser

## Learning Outcomes
- Strong understanding of JavaScript fundamentals
- Confidence in handling DOM events and user input
- Ability to build interactive web applications without libraries
- Improved debugging and logical thinking skills

## Future Enhancements
