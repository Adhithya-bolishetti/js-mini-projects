# JavaScript Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript mini projects built from scratch using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The goal of this repository is to strengthen core JavaScript fundamentals through hands-on practice and real-world examples.

## Objectives
- Understand JavaScript basics and ES6 features
- Practice DOM manipulation and event handling
- Implement input validation and user interactions
- Build interactive UI components without frameworks
- Improve problem-solving and debugging skills

## Projects Included

### 1. Counter App
